# Datasyn-Deep-learning
Deep Learning course from ntnu TDT4265, where this git has code on how to build networks from the grounds up just with numpy as well as using Pytorch. The final project was a very extensive project on Realtime Road Damage Detection with a Single Shot Detector. I decided to go ahead and use a ResNext50 model for my backbone.
